# HydroponicSystemArduino
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants with water media without using soil media and prioritizing the fulfillment of plant nutritional needs. A hydroponic cultivation system that circulates water and nutrients using the Deep Flow Technique (DFT) method. Pakcoi vegetables were developed on the Serpong Farm Hydroponic plantation. The activities carried out were measuring pH, TDS, and temperature levels in hydroponic plant solution media, still using a simple meter which caused it to be ineffective, could cause reading errors in these levels, and required time to match the nutrient solution content. This study aims to build an Android-based system that can automatically control nutrient levels and pH using the Fuzzy Logic method with stages starting from fuzzification, application of rules, defuzzification and output as decision making from the system. The Fuzzy Logic model with the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang method is applied to the Arduino Mega 2560 using the C programming language.
